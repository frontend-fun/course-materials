Instead of meeting with a TA in person or on Zoom, everyone will instead be submitting an INDIVIDUAL video recording of
them reviewing a subset of their contributions to their project's codebase.

Each student is responsible for a ~5 minute video that uses their commit history to summarize their 2-3 biggest
contributions to the project and how they work. Your goal is to demonstrate that:

  * You had a significant contribution to the teams' final project
  * You understand what your code does

You must show specific commits that YOU authored, in the history of your project, via the GitHub Interface. You may find
it helpful to also show off the features in action on the live website during your video, but showing actual lines of
code is necessary too.

Focus on showing commits that involve TypeScript and React logic. Do not focus on commits that simply modify data or
configuration files. Tests are good too, but make sure you are demonstrating non-testing code too.

There are several ways to record video from your computer screen, including Zoom, Open Broadcast Software (OBS), and
others. Please be sure that the audio and video are clear. Any text on the screen must also be readable.

Some of you wrote a huge amount of code; you should only be showing the lines of code that are best representative of
your biggest contributions. Focus on quality, not quantity.
