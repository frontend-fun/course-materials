You must fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you're gonna write a bunch of functions in TypeScript. You need to pass a bunch of unit tests.

Read this page and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-
tome/3-control/primitives.html>

This is a real crash course into TypeScript. You might not absorb everything. Be prepared to jump back here and reread
stuff, and to google a lot of extra information as you need it. I may not tell you every thing you need, but remember
that you have the internet at your disposal.

The changes you make to the site are not visible. So, instead of submitting your website's link like last time, we
actually want you to add `/test_report.txt` to the end. So if your URL used to be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks`,
then now it will be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks/test_report.txt`

**When you are done, submit the URL of the TEST REPORT.**
