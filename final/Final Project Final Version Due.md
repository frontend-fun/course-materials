For this submission, you must include:

  1. A link to your deployed site
  2. A bulleted summary of the changes you have made that justify increasing your grade. Review the feedback from the MVP submission and make sure you respond to specific issues that were raised.

You will be graded based on:

  * Completion of the core features (IE the functionality for the MVP), with additional credit for completing more advanced features
  * Quality of the codebase, including things like function/variable naming, use of decomposition
  * Quality of your tests, including coverage, quantity, and variety
  * Quality of the user experience
  * Quality of the development process, including commit history and use of project boards
  * How you contributed to the team's success

Your codebase must be in compliance with the rules established in the original project description, including the use of
TypeScript, React Hooks, linting, and testing.

Only the live version of your site will be graded; the version locally on your computer does not count!

This is the final submission for your project! Make sure all your core features are done by this point.
