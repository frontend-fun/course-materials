By the end of this Sprint, you will be expected to have finished the Minimal Viable Product of your application. You
should think about this from the user's perspective - does your application fulfill the basic needs for someone to make
a graduation plan as CIS major?

In addition to completing features, look critically at your codebase. How are your tests? Do you have tests for each
feature that you've implemented?

How are your variable names? Your functions? Your decomposition into components and functions? Is the code easy to read
and understand, or is it needlessly complicated? Do you have clear interfaces with good field names?

We are as much about the quality of your codebase as we do your completion of features!

During your Planning Session, you need to discuss what you are going to work on next. Return your Sprint Backlog to your
Product Backlog. Then, decide if you need to update your estimates for any tasks. Choose new items to move into your
Sprint Backlog. Decide if you need to break tasks down further as you go.

I recommend describing User Stories in more detail by specifying Acceptance Criteria: <https://www.visual-

For this assignment, submit your Project Board URL. Make sure everyone has been clearly labelled with their tasks (e.g.,
by using @username syntax, or Github Issues).
