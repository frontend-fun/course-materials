You should fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you are going to eventually make your own Quizzer!

Read the two pages linked here and follow the instructions for the second page: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-
hooks-typescript-tome/5-complex/>{: .external}

This task is VERY different from the previous ones. We have established a bunch of requirements, and want to see what
you can do with them. You can earn partial credit for completing more of them. You also earn credit for effectively
testing them, and for sketching out the application (embed the sketch in your completed website).

The task initially locks soon to make sure you submit before then. We intend to review your completed work at that point
to help in deciding teams. There will be more time to work on this task up until the final project begins, in order to
increase your grade. Recognize, however, that we will NOT accept any more tasks once the final project begins.

Observe the rubric for grading this assignment: we are giving some points for completing a feature, and the rest of the
points for testing the feature. We value tests! We also value different requirements in different amounts - some
features are harder or more important, and are therefore worth more! Keep Decide how to spend your time strategically.

Submit the regular URL (like `https://adabart.github.io/tasks/`) as soon as you begin, so that you do not run the risk
of forgetting to submit. We will not grade the task until the initial lock date.

**When you START THE TASK, submit the URL of your deployed web page.**

As you complete requirements, add them to a bulleted list of "Completed Features" that we can see on your website. ****
