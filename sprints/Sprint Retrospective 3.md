This assignment has the same protocol and submission structure as [Sprint Retrospective 1.](https://udel.instructure.com/courses/1631620/assignments/9887371 "Sprint Retrospective 1")

By this point, you've had some experience with the Agile methodology and how it works for your team. Now that you're
comfortable with the structure, modify it as you need to fit your team's needs! There's lots of different ways to
appraise your performance and plan ahead, so try to find one that you feel will be most helpful. One method that's
similar to Start/Stop/Continue is the Roses, Thorns, and Buds method:

Roses: What went well? (Similar to Continue)

Thorns: What went poorly? (Similar to start/stop)

Buds: What actions can be taken to turn those thorns into roses? (like Start, but more goal-focused).

Of course, if you think Start/Stop/Continue works well, then by all means keep using it! But don't be afraid to
experiment and see what fits your team best.
