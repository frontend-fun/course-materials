For your first Planning Meeting, you will be working with your teammates to define your first sprint and some key
details about your project.

### Step 1 - Backlog

Take the User Stories, expand and refine them as needed, and add them as Notes in the Project Board. You might also give
preliminary estimate scores. They should all go under the Product Backlog at first.

### Step 2 - Personas

Make up some Personas for a few example users of your application, and put them into a Markdown file in your repository. These are imaginary users who might want to try and use your application. Think about different combinations of student characteristics. Here are some questions you can use, based on [this site](https://www.hotjar.com/blog/user-personas/){: .inline_disabled}:

  * Who are you?

  * What’s your main goal?

  * What’s your main barrier to achieving this goal?

Don't spend too long on this, just make sure you have a few different users who are distinct from each other and that
you can imagine using your application.

### Step 3 - Mockup

You will want to spend some time making a mockup of your application, either on paper or in a program like Draw.IO,
Figma, or even perhaps PowerPoint. Personally, I prefer paper and pencil for making wire frames and diagrams. Do not
worry about minor details or making it look beautiful - you are unlikely to stick with the initial design anyway. Add
the completed diagram to your repository.

### Step 4 - Data Model

Spend a little bit of time talking about the data model, and make some clear notes. You do not have to write any code,
but you may end up writing down some interfaces. Make the relationship between different interfaces clear by indicating
collections. Think about what types of data you should have for everything.

### Step 5 - Estimate and Assign Items

As a team, you should move items from your Product Backlog to your Sprint Backlog once you decide what you will do in
this first Sprint; then you can move them to the Todo section when you have decided who will do them (be sure to assign
them by including a "@username" reference in the Note, or by assigning the Issue). Assign estimates for the tasks by
putting numbers into their cards.

### Submission

For this assignment, provide a direct link to any diagrams, personas, or other planning artifacts that you created. Also
provide a direct link to your project board. Each step should be represented in your submission.
