You must fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you're gonna write even more functions in TypeScript, this time about ARRAYS (although they should really
be called "lists" but whatever). You need to pass a bunch of unit tests.

Read this page and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-
tome/3-control/arrays.html>

 (Links to an external site.)

Things get a bit trickier here, since we have to worry about IMMUTABILITY. If you try to rely on google alone for these,
you are VERY likely to get them wrong. Read over the chapter and make sure you understand why we are using the
map/filter/reduce/etc functions. **Note that we WILL reject solutions that use `for` loops, `while` loops, or
recursion.** We expect you to use the idioms we teach you!

The changes you make to the site are not visible. So, instead of submitting your website's link like last time, we
actually want you to add `/test_report.txt` to the end. So if your URL used to be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks`,
then now it will be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks/test_report.txt`

**When you are done, submit the URL of the TEST REPORT.**
