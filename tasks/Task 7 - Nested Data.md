You must fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you're gonna write STILL EVEN MORE functions in TypeScript, this time about Objects AND Arrays. You need
to pass a bunch of unit tests.

Read this page and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-
tome/3-control/nested.html>

This page is very brief, but there are SO MANY functions for you to define. You basically need to combine what you
learned in the rest of the chapter. If this course was a game, then this would be the midboss. Read over the chapter and
make sure you understand why we are not mutating the arrays and objects.  **Note that we WILL reject solutions that
incorrectly use for/while/recursion OR mutate the data instead of making copies.**  We expect you to use the idioms we
teach you!

The changes you make to the site are not visible. So, instead of submitting your website's link like last time, we
actually want you to add `/test_report.txt` to the end. So if your URL used to be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks`,
then now it will be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks/test_report.txt`

**When you are done, submit the URL of the TEST REPORT.**
