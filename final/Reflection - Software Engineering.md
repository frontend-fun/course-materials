This course is an "Introduction to Software Engineering". Please take a little time to reflect on what you have learned
about "Software Engineering" based on what we have tried to teach about the subject. Then, you will need to write a
response to BOTH prompts below.

  1. Explain the three most important things you learned this semester about "Software Engineering". Do not simply list buzzwords or copy definitions - provide a clear description that demonstrates your understanding.
  2. Explain why the following answer is inappropriate for the previous prompt: " _This semester, the biggest thing about Software Engineering that I learned was TypeScript and React._ "

Please use complete sentences, proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. If we cannot understand your answer, then it
will be marked wrong.

You may use bulleted lists and other appropriate formatting to enhance your answer.

There is no minimum or maximum length for this assignment. However, we recommend about 100-300 words for the first
prompt and about 50-150 words for the second prompt.

You will be graded not only on the quality of what you have learned, but also on the quality of your description of what
you have learned.
