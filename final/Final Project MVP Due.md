Provide a link to your published website.

You will be graded based on:

  * Completion of the core features with a Minimal Viable Product live on your site
  * Quality of the codebase, including things like function/variable naming, use of decomposition, and sufficient tests
  * Quality of the development process, including commit history and use of project boards
  * Quality of the user experience

Your codebase must be in compliance with the rules established in the original project description, including the use of
TypeScript, React Hooks, linting, and testing.

Only the live version of your site will be graded; the version locally on your computer does not count!
