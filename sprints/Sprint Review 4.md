This will be an in-class presentation for each team to show off their projects so far.

You should make absolutely sure that you will be in class on Tuesday and Thursday to help your team present your demo.

Demos will be short (3 minutes per group). No PowerPoint slides, just showing off your website live in the browser from
the deployed URL.

Each team will present to the entire class. You are expected to be respectful to classmates.

This might be a chance to see how other teams are solving problems that you are having, and to seek some additional peer
help!

More Details:

  * Your goal is to present your features. You don't have to explain how your site works, your goal is to treat us as users and product owners. Think of us as students and advisers who are considering your application to help them design their schedule. What can you show off?
  * The order of teams will be chosen randomly
  * Each team is allocated a maximum of 3 minutes to present.
  * The URL of your team's deployed website will be loaded at least 15 minutes before the lecture begins. I do not recommend pushing changes directly before your demo, since it is likely that you will break the site and ruin your demo!
  * Attendance is mandatory; there will be a severe grade penalty for skipping this lecture! 
    * Obviously, if you are sick or your house has exploded, then you should not come. But unless you have a good reason, I expect you to be here!
  * Some presentations will take place on the Thursday
