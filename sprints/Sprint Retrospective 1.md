Your team needs to have a Sprint Retrospective. You can do the Retrospective immediately after your Sprint Review, but
they should be treated as two separate meetings. This is a chance to look at the process of your Sprint. Decide what
worked well, and what didn't. Everything that affects how the team develops the product is open for dissection,
including processes, tools, artifacts, environment, and interactions. This is the time for your team to figure out how
to adapt the workflow to your needs.

You should use the Start/Stop/Continue model by brainstorming a list of practices that you want to start, stop, or
continue using. This guide gives a brief overview: <https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/a-simple-way-to-run-a-
sprint-retrospective>

You might want to use actual sticky notes, or an online tool like [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/){: .inline_disabled}.

Write down a summary of what your team decided to start/stop/continue. This can be bulleted lists or a link to the
jamboard or a paragraph, whatever makes the most sense. There is no minimum or maximum number of items to discuss, but
we expect at least a few good ones overall. We'd be surprised if everything was working perfectly, but if so then it
should be clear that you identify the practices you are continuing!
