You must fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you're gonna write even more functions in TypeScript, this time about OBJECTS. You need to pass a bunch
of unit tests.

Read this page and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-
tome/3-control/objects.html>

We once again have to worry about IMMUTABILITY. If you try to rely on google alone for these, you are VERY likely to get
them wrong. Read over the chapter and make sure you understand why we are not mutating the objects.  **Note that we WILL
reject solutions that incorrectly mutate the data instead of making copies.**  We expect you to use the idioms we teach
you!

The changes you make to the site are not visible. So, instead of submitting your website's link like last time, we
actually want you to add `/test_report.txt` to the end. So if your URL used to be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks`,
then now it will be `https://adabart.github.io/tasks/test_report.txt`

**When you are done, submit the URL of the TEST REPORT.**
