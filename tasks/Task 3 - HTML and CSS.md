You must fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you will be learning a lot of new terminology and writing HTML and CSS for your first web application. By
the end, your website will have text, images, buttons, and more!

Read Chapter 2 and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-tome/2-app/>

Make sure you read "All the Concepts" AND "Basic HTML and CSS". The Task is in the second page. There's a lot to read
here, but just do your best to absorb what you can - most of it makes more sense once you are in the thick of it.

There are also TWO subtasks not represented in the unit tests. Make sure you read all the instructions in order to earn
credit for this Task.

**When you are done, submit the URL of your deployed web page.**
