You must fully complete the previous task BEFORE moving on to this task.

For this task, you will be creating your first Components! There's a lot to learn, and a lot to do, but things will
start getting a lot more fun from here.

Read this page and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-
tome/4-state/state.html>

As part of this Task, you might need to remove some existing code, and you might encounter some merge conflicts. Once
you get past that, you will find that there are a lot of user requirements to pass, in addition to the tests. Although
we are relying heavily on the tests to check your code, we will also look at your application to make sure it works
correctly in practice. Make sure you complete all requirements for all the components!

Unlike the last few tasks, your changes will finally be visible again on the public URL. This time, you must not submit
your Test Report, but instead the regular URL (like `https://adabart.github.io/tasks/`).

**When you are done, submit the URL of your deployed web page.**
