During your Planning Session, you need to discuss what you are going to work on next. Return your Sprint Backlog to your
Product Backlog. Then, decide if you need to update your estimates for any tasks. Choose new items to move into your
Sprint Backlog. Decide if you need to break tasks down further as you go.

For this assignment, submit your Project Board URL. Make sure everyone has been clearly labelled with their tasks (e.g.,
by using @username syntax, or Github Issues).

Tasks should be assigned taking into account relative ability levels and skills. We expect you all to make a significant
contribution each week, but not everyone will have the same kind of contribution.
