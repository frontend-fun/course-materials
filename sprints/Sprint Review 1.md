At the end of a Sprint, you are responsible for having a Review event. Per the Agile manifesto:

> During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in
> their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also
> be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting
> it to a presentation.

In this course, we expect your Review to be a full team meeting that will probably take less than an hour, and leads to
you creating a <1 minute video reviewing what you have accomplished in the sprint. That video is what you will submit
for this assignment. However, it is not the only thing you do during this meeting: it is a chance for your group to sync
up on what you have done.

The video isn't *just* a presentation, but most of it probably will be a presentation showing off what you have done.
Features of your website might be broken or in progress, but you can still talk about them and show them off. Explain
what you are working on next.

You are talking to your client, not a developer. Assume they have a high-level knowledge of coding but won't understand
low-level details of your application. They are focused on features, not code.

I think [this is a friendly guide](https://appliedframeworks.com/how-to-run-an-effective-sprint-review/){: .inline_disabled} with more details on a full, proper Sprint Review. Since we're in a class situation, we're not going to have you meeting with Product Owners and you're not getting Real-time feedback. Still, it's valuable to understand what you would be doing in a more full Agile experience.
