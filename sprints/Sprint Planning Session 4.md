By the end of this Sprint, you will be expected to have finished the Minimal Viable Product of your scheduler. That
doesn't mean all features completed - that means you should have a basic working application that shows off the big core
features. This will be critical since in Sprint Review 4 your team will be demoing your application to the entire class.
If you have already finished the core functionality, great! If not, then you know what you need to focus on this week.

During your Planning Session, you need to discuss what you are going to work on next. Return your Sprint Backlog to your
Product Backlog. Then, decide if you need to update your estimates for any tasks. Choose new items to move into your
Sprint Backlog. Decide if you need to break tasks down further as you go.

I recommend describing User Stories in more detail by specifying Acceptance Criteria: <https://www.visual-

For this assignment, submit your Project Board URL. Make sure everyone has been clearly labelled with their tasks (e.g.,
by using @username syntax, or Github Issues).
