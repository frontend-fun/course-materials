Your first task is to set up your environment.

Read this page and follow its instructions: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-
tome/1-setup/environment.html>

**When you are done, submit the URL of your deployed web page.**

Make sure that the site is properly deployed! You will not receive credit if your site fails to deploy because of errors
with linting, tests, etc.

### Wait, what are these tasks?

Check the [Syllabus](../Syllabus.md)!
