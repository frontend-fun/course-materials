Agile is going to be our strategy for the next couple months. Here are some videos to introduce the content. The voice
is a little monotone, but I think they do a good job with the graphics. I found some other videos I thought did a better
job explaining the Review and Retrospective. There's a ton of videos out there to explain these ideas, and some versions
will conflict with each other. This is some fuzzy stuff - take everything with a grain of salt. Still, hopefully you get
the gist of what they should look like by the end!

### Working

After the daily scrum, you do a lot of work. This is the actual coding bit.
